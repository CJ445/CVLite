# 💡CVLite — Your AI Assistant for Object Detection Fine-Tuning

CVLite is an intelligent assistant that helps you fine-tune object detection models tailored to your **specific real-world use case** — from finding the best model for edge deployment to curating datasets and generating fine-tuning scripts. Just tell CVLite what you want to detect, and it does the rest.

## 🧠 What It Does

> _“Hey CVLite, I want to fine-tune a drone detection model that runs on a Raspberry Pi.”_

✅ CVLite will:
- 🔍 **Find the best-suited object detection models** for your use case (e.g., lightweight, accurate, edge-compatible like YOLOv8n, MobileNet SSD, etc.)
- 🌐 **Search and fetch open datasets** relevant to your task (e.g., labeled drone images in the sky)
- 📁 **Set up your dataset directory structure** automatically
- 📜 **Generate fine-tuning scripts and configs** for training on your custom or fetched data
- 🧭 Provide instructions for using your **own dataset** if needed
- 🧪 Suggest evaluation metrics and visualization tools
- 🧠 Optimize model export for **edge deployment** (ONNX, TFLite, etc.)

## ⚙️ Example Usage

Just describe your problem:

```bash
cvlite --task "I want to fine-tune an object detection model to detect drones in the sky with high accuracy and deploy it on a Raspberry Pi."
```

CVLite will:
- Suggest: `YOLOv8n` or `MobileNet SSD`
- Download: Open drone detection datasets from sources like Roboflow or Kaggle
- Set up: Dataset folder + label formats
- Generate: `train.py` with proper hyperparams
- Export: A model ready for edge deployment

## 📦 Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/cvlite.git
cd cvlite
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
